# MCSD Certification Projects

These projects were created as part of preparation for MCSD Certification Exam 70-483 (Programming in C#).
Directories/Projects are based on chapters from the book 'MCSD Certification Toolkit - Exam 70-483 Programming in C#' by Tiberiu Covaci et altri.
All projects are original, although snippets may have been copied from the book.
